# Coverage instrumentation, gcc/clang only and off by default -- never in a

# third-party dependencies (Catch2, pugixml) are never instrumented: their gcov
# data is noise the report filters out anyway, and their sources are not
# resolvable relative to the project root, which newer gcovr treats as a hard
# error. Call nucleus_enable_coverage(<target>) on every first-party target
# whose translation units should emit counters -- the libraries AND the test
# executables (test TUs instantiate header-inline library code that would
# otherwise lose its counts). MSVC has no gcov equivalent here, so the flags
# are guarded to the GNU/Clang front ends.
